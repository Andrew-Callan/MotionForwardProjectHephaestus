# Project Hephaestus

**Project Hephaestus** is a robust infrastructure provisioning solution that leverages Terraform and Ansible to create a dynamic cloud networking environment. Designed specifically for red teaming / blue teaming exercises, it sets up machines and networks that simulate increasing levels of difficulty as attackers progress, providing a comprehensive training ground for cybersecurity professionals.

## Project Title and Description

**Project Hephaestus** is an automated infrastructure provisioning tool built with Terraform and Ansible. It creates a secure cloud environment with a series of virtual machines that are progressively more challenging to compromise. This setup is ideal for red/blue team exercises, penetration testing, and security training.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Provisioning**: Deploy a complete cloud infrastructure with a single command.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Machines and networks designed with increasing complexity.
- **Red Team Training**: Realistic environment for security assessments and training.
- **Blue Team Training**: Attacks monitored through cyber tools allowing defensive training

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.9.5 used for dev)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- Access to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and proper credentials set up.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Callan/MotionForwardProjectHephaestus.git
cd MotionForwardProjectHephaestus
```

### Terraform Setup

1. **Initialize Terraform**: 

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

2. **Plan the Infrastructure**:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

3. **Apply the Configuration**:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

### Ansible Setup

1. **Install Ansible Roles**:

    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
    ```

2. **Run Ansible Playbooks**:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbook.yml
    ```

## Usage

### Terraform Configuration

- **`main.tf`**: Contains the core infrastructure configuration.
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines variables for customization.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Outputs values such as public IPs for easy access.

### Ansible Configuration

- **`playbook.yml`**: Main Ansible playbook for configuring the machines.
- **`roles/`**: Directory containing roles for different configurations.
- **`inventory/hosts`**: Inventory file listing the target machines.

### Example Workflow

1. Provision the infrastructure using Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

2. Configure the machines using Ansible:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbook.yml
    ```

## Configuration

Customize the following files to adjust the environment to your needs:

- **`terraform.tfvars`**: Set your cloud provider credentials and other variables.
- **`ansible/roles/`**: Modify role configurations for different machine setups.
